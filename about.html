<div class="sixteen columns"> <subh> Artist's Statement </subh><indent><p> Before I ever sat down in a class room, I was learning. I always figured the best way to learn something was to experience it, and I believe that’s how my creativity developed. From the first photoshop file I opened, the first line of code I wrote, or the the first camera I held in my hands, I was on my own, driven by pure curiosity and the desire to learn something new. And as I developed these skills, unbridled by the restrictions of a classroom , I realized how much I enjoyed accomplishing the goals I set for myself and improving my skills. It wasn’t until I got older that I realized this creativity I enjoyed so much could one day become a part of my career and began to further my education in the classroom.</p> <p> 
</indent>
<indent>
No matter whether I’m designing or developing, photographing or writing, I always strive to take the most creative and unique approach to my work that I can imagine. I don’t stop until I’m completely satisfied, and then I keep working to make it better. I’m inspired by the constantly changing society around us to update and improve what I create, motivated that I could be a part of that change. A good artist should always be improving, never stopping until they are truly proud of their work. As long as I am proud of my work, I know I have done well.
